{c: VERSE}
[Gm]We all came out to Montreux[F]		[Gm]On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile		We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers		Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun		Burned the place to the ground

{c: CHORUS}
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water,[G5] a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

{c: INTRO (x2)}

{c: VERSE2}
They burned down the gambling house	It died with an awful sound
A funky Claude was running in and out.	Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over. we had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out, it seemed that we would lose the race.

{c: CHORUS}
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water,[G5] a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

{c: INTRO (x2)}

{c: VERSE3}
We ended up at the Grand Hotel		It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds	We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this		I know, I know we'll never forget

{c: CHORUS}
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water,[G5] a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
