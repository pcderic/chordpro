# chordpro

## Purpose

Public sharing of my [chordpro](https://www.chordpro.org/) content (chords and lyrics), with fellow musicians. I've also included PDF-formatted equivalents for easier reading (for those without a chordpro file parser/reader).

This is meant to complement my youtube channel: [@pcderic](https://www.youtube.com/@pcderic).

Collaborate online with me on Bandhug at: [bandhug.com/@pcderic](https://www.bandhug.com/@pcderic).

> Give and you shall receive! ;-)
